# Auto-Sorting-TrashCan
Science fair - Auto-sorting trashcan 
This project is an AI-driven waste classification and sorting system using computer vision and Raspberry Pi. It detects objects inside a trash can, classifies them into Recycling, Compost, or Landfill, and automatically sorts them using servo motors.

✅ Object Detection – Uses a Raspberry Pi camera to detect if an object is inside the trash can
✅ AI Classification – A TensorFlow Lite model classifies the object as Recycling, Compost, or Landfill
✅ Automated Sorting – Servo motors move the object to the correct bin
✅ Edge Computing – Runs efficiently on a Raspberry Pi

🛠️ Hardware Requirements
Raspberry Pi (4/5 recommended)
Pi Camera Module
Servo Motors (x3) for sorting mechanism
NIR Sensor (Optional) for material detection
Weight & Moisture Sensors (Optional)
